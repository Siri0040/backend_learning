Functions #2: print Hello Name
NOTE: Define the function, but do not run it!

Define a function called myfunc  that takes in a name, and prints 'Hello Name' 

Also, do not use f-strings, as they are not supported in this Coding Exercise.

For example: 
	def myfunc(name):
		print ('My name is {}'.format(name))
		


Remember, do not run the function! However, if we were to pass in a name, it would look like this:

myfunc('Jose')
#Output: My name is Jose
