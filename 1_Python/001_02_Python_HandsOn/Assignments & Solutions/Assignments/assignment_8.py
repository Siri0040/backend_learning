'''
Write an expression using any of the string formatting methods we have learned. (except f-strings, see note below) to return the phrase 'Python rules!'

For example, these phrases both return 'I like apples': 
1. 'I like %s' %'apples'
2. 'I like {}'.format('apples')

Your solution should be entered on one line. You can not use variable names, only the strings themselves.
