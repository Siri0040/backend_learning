Functions #8: *args

Define a function called myfunc that takes in arbitrary number of arguments and returns the sum of those arguments. 

Remember, don't run the function, simply provide the definition.

For example, a function that returns a count of the number of arbitrary arguments might look like:
	def myfunc(*args):
		return len(args)
This is all you need to enter!
To give an idea what the above function would look like when tested:  
	myfunc(1,5,7,9)
	#Output: 4
