Functions #7: is greater

Define a function called is_greater that takes in two arguments, and returns True if the first value is greater than the second, False if it is less than or equal to the second. 

Remember, don't run the function, simply provide the definition.

For example, a function that returns True if a value is less than the second might look like:
	def is_less(c,d):
		if c<d:
			return True
		else: 
			return False
This is all you need to enter!
To give an idea what the above function would look like when tested:  
	is_less(1,5)
	#Output: True
