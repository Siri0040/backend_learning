Functions #5: simple math
Define a function called myfunc that takes in two arguments and returns their sum.

Remember, don't run the function, simply provide the definition.

For example, a function that takes in two arguments and returns their product  might look like:
	def myfunc(a,b):
		return a*b
This is all you need to enter!
To give an idea what the above function would look like when tested:

	myfunc(2,10)
	#Output: 20
