Functions #6: is even
Define a function called is_even that takes in one argument, and returns  if the passed-in value is even, False if it is not.
Remember, don't run the function, simply provide the definition.

For example, a function that returns True if a value is divisible by 3 might look like:

	def is_evenly_divisible_by_3(n):
		if n%3==0:
			return True
		else: 
			return False
This is all you need to enter!
To give an idea what the above function would look like when tested:  
	is_evenly_divisible_by_3(15)
	#Output: True
	
Added note: this exercise requires that the function return True or False. Print statements will not work here.
