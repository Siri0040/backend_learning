Functions #9: pick evens

Define a function called myfunc that takes in arbitrary number of arguments and returns a list of only those arguments that are even. 

Remember, don't run the function, simply provide the definition.

To give an idea what the above function would look like when tested:  
	myfunc(1,4,5,6)
	#Output: [6,8]
