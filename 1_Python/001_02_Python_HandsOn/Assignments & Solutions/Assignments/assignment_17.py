Functions #4 - using Booleans

Define a function called myfunc that takes three arguments, x,y and z. 
If z is True, return x. if z is False, return y. 

Remember, don't run the function, simply provide the definition. 

For example, a function that returns a if c is True and b if c is False might look like: 
	def myfunc(a,b,c):
		if c==True:
			return a
		else:
			return b
			
This is all you need to enter!

To give you an idea what the function would look like when tested: 
	myfunc('Hello','Goodbye', False)
	#Output: 'Goodbye'
