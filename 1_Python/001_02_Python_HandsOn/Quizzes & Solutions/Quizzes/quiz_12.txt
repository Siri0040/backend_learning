1. What is wrong with this Python loop:
		n = 5
		while n > 0 :

		print 'All done'
					a. This loop will run forever
					b. The print 'All done' statement should be indented four spaces
					c. There should be no colon on the while statement
					d. while is not a Python reserved word
					
2. What does the break statement do?
					a. Jumps to the "top" of the loop and starts the next iteration
					b. Resets the iteration variable to its initial value
					c. Exits the currently executing loop
					d. Exits the program
					
3. What does the continue statement do?
					a. Exits the currently executing loop
					b. Jumps to the "top" of the loop and starts the next iteration
					c. Resets the iteration variable to its initial value
					d. Exits the program
					
4. What does the following Python program print out?
			tot = 0 
			for i in [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] :
				tot = tot + 1
			print tot
					a. 5
					b. 15
					c. 10
					d. 0
					
5. What is the iteration variable in the following Python code:
			friends = ['Joseph', 'Glenn', 'Sally']
			for friend in friends :

			print 'Done!'
					a. friend
					b. Sally
					c. Glenn
					d. Joseph
					
6. What is a good description of the following bit of Python code?
			zork = 0
			for thing in [9, 41, 12, 3, 74, 15] :
				zork = zork + thing
			print 'After', zork
					a. Compute the average of the elements in a list
					b. Find the smallest item in a list
					c. Sum all the elements of a list
					d. Count all of the elements in a list

7. What will the following code print out?
			smallest_so_far = -1
			for the_num in [9, 41, 12, 3, 74, 15] :
			   if the_num < smallest_so_far :
				  smallest_so_far = the_num
			print smallest_so_far
					a. -1
					b. 74
					c. 42
					d. 3
					
8. What is a good statement to describe the is operator as used in the following if statement:
			if smallest is None :
     			smallest = value
					a. The if statement is a syntax error
					b. Is true if the smallest variable has a value of -1
					c. Looks up 'None' in the smallest variable if it is a string
					d. matches both type and value

9. Which reserved word indicates the start of an "indefinite" loop in Python?
					a. while
					b. for
					c. indef
					d. break
					e. def

10. How many times will the body of the following loop be executed?
			n = 0
			while n > 0 :
